                <h2>Hello there ! I'm Roja Shrestha</h2>
                <p>A little mysterious, a little lazy but deeply passionate about creativity and learning.
I won’t brag about my skills or projects here, because honestly, I haven’t mastered anything yet. 
I like to keep things simple and raw but with a touch of perfection.

As a Computer Science student, I want to code. But truth be told, I don’t always enjoy it.
 Still, there's a part of me that dreams of building life-changing technology. 
 Maybe God has different plans for me but I’m here, exploring every possibility.

I haven’t quite figured out what I truly love, but being creative feels like a part of me.
Beyond tech, I’m deeply curious about astrology and people’s personalities you could call me nosy, or just genuinely concerned.

This space is a reflection of me ; honest, evolving, and unfinished. Just like all of us. 🌙</p>

    <h3>Story I want to cover</h3>
    <p>✨
I don’t know exactly where life will take me a few years from now and that’s okay. 
But one thing has always been clear: my deep love for beauty and self-care. 
As a tech student, I’ve often felt caught between two worlds : the creative and the technical 
but I’ve come to realize that I don’t have to choose. 
My dream is to create something meaningful that blends both.
 want to build tools, tell stories, and craft digital spaces that help people feel confident in their skin, 
 understand their beauty from the inside out, and embrace self-love through technology. 
 Because beauty isn’t just how we look. It’s how we feel, how we grow, and how we show up for ourselves. 
 And if I can make even one person feel more seen, more empowered, more beautiful ,
then that’s the kind of impact I want to make.</p>
